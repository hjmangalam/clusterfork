Clusterfork Changelog

# 1.86  (09-10-17 Fixed sometimes odd behavior with --refresh, .clusterfork-ignore
        so that --refresh now deletes and then refreshes .clusterfork-ignore, so that
        ONLY freshly ignorable hosts are exist in the .clusterfork-ignore file.
        If don't use --refresh, then after the $REFRESHPERIOD (now 4hrs), it gets 
        regenerated anyway.
# 1.84  (06-19-16) FIXED: doesn't seem to be ignoring the IGNORE line.
        (11.5.16) DONE: place unresponsive nodes into the IGNORE section or file
        DONE: refresh that on file and  --refresh or every X hrs (set in rc file).
        TODO: put the current --list output into the less pager
        DONE: only output 'Unresponsive hosts if there are some
# 1.83   (06-19-16) FIXED: doesn't seem to be ignoring the IGNORE line.
        (11.5.16) DONE: place unresponsive nodes into the IGNORE section or file
        TODO: refresh that on file and  --refresh or every X hrs (set in rc file).
        TODO: put the current --list output into the less pager
        DONE: only output 'Unresponsive hosts if there are some
        DONE: also, sep the unresponsive nodes to paste into the .clusterforkrc IGNORE line.
        DONE: put the 'unresponsive error messages on the same line as the node if possible
        DONE: (put the newline before the line is printed, instead of after.)
 1.82 - (06-16-16) log unresponsive nodes to Summary file.

# 1.82 - (06-16-16) log unresponsive nodes to Summary file.
# 1.81 - (04-19-16) add md5 checksum filtering of output files 
         into identical-content  dirs and symlink the output file 
         names to the correct ones.
# 1.80 - (2-10-14) added filters to strip annoying spurious errors 
         from out put, especially 
         "Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11
         forwarding."  Include the filter string as part of the config 
         file, not the code.
# 1.79 - (11-08-13) added '--skip' so can skip processing of a node that 
         has been used as a guinea pig and now no longer needs to be processed
         fixed IGNORE group handling so that can use either IP# or hostname
         fixed some doc errors
# 1.78 - (09-12-13) should only show scrolling changes once the list has
         changed from 1st list.  so if there are 22 hosts in list, the scroll 
         shouldn't start until the list drops to 21
# 1.77 - (06-14-2013) cosmetic changes; narrow output, short-circuit 
         last 2s wait, rename output dir from 'REMOTE-CMD' to CF'.
# 1.76 - (05.1.13) FIXED: complains about IP#-based host specs, so have to
         make sure it can take specs like 10.3.22.[4:45] without barfing.
         FIXED: handles unresolved IP#s better - times out in 1s waiting 
         for ping & continues
         FIXED: characters like < & > fail
         FIXED: # hosts left stays at 0 instead of tracking the # correctly.
# 1.75 - (11.29.12) add final timing line to LOG so can grep for it more
         easily. 
# 1.74 - (10.15.12) shortcut final pointless 2s cycle at end
# 1.73 - (10.04.12) set a timeout for --script version to prevent infinite
         hanging.
# 1.72 - (08.20.12) small mod to delete empty files before asking to view
         them.
