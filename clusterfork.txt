.Summary
*******************************************************************************
'clusterfork' (aka 'cf') is a commandline perl script for issuing the same command to many computers simultaneously via ssh, collating the results of that command by node, and presenting those results to the user in a number of ways to judge whether it has been successful.  It can be scripted as well as used interactively, logging the usual output.

For example, the following line will show you the correctable and uncorrectable memory errors on the nodes 10.255.78.20 thru 10.255.78.60.  Change the IP range to your own and try it yourself. Obviously, the machines have to be using the http://buttersideup.com/edacwiki/Main_Page[EDAC system].

Introduction
------------

While modern cluster technologies (Perceus, Warewulf, ROCKS) *should* obviate the need for this kind of
utility, there are many non-Perceus/WW/ROCKS clusters and even more cluster-like aggregations of nodes that often need this kind of tool.  Even in Perceus/WW/ROCKS clusters there's often the need to issue a command to each node to evaluate hardware, search logs, determine memory errors, etc that is not met by the provisioning system.



Features
--------
Why use clusterfork rather than the tools noted link:#alternatives[below]?

*clusterfork*:

- is config file-based (and will write an example template if one doesn't exist). You can also specify alternative config files.
- has an easy way to specify large, discontinuous IP# ranges with negations: ie 128.200.34.[23:45 -25 77:155 -100:-120] will send the cmd to the nodes (on net 128.200.34.0) 23 to 45 EXCEPT 25 and then 77 to 155 EXCEPT the nodes 100 to 120.  Such specifications can also be chained or instantiated in the config file. See link:#SpecifyingRanges[Specifying Ranges] below.
- config file can specify IP ranges based on arbitrary scripts such as SGE's 'qhost'.
- can combine IP ranges into larger groups via 'named group addition' (GRP1 + GRP2 + GRP3)
- is pretty fast (by default, forks commands so that they execute in parallel).
- comes with at least a decent amount of documentation, both external (this file) as well as internal help (clusterfork -h)
- code is short (<1000LOC, including rc file template and help text), pretty well-documented and easy to modify.
- provides a mechanism to evaluate the results of the command (like pssh, but better).
- can archive the results, altho in a fairly primitive way.
- can be used to (crudely) monitor the status of a cluster's locally installed software.
- will filter which IP #s overlap in a command so nodes won't receive multiple copies of commands.
- provides multiple mechanisms for showing results: 'MD5 hash' and 'wordcount' of machine-specific output to show both 'exact' and 'similar' output, as well as saving the output for later perusal in a newly created subdir which also contains a summary file.  You can view the output as a summary, or via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander[Midnight Commander] browsing of the results dir.
- captures STDERR as well as STDOUT into the node-specific files.
- tracks running hosts to identify hung or trailing hosts.
- can be config'ed to write results files to a specific dir or in the current dir
- will delete empty results files before presenting them for evaluation (but note them in the Summary).
- can be scripted to log the usual output, returning the results directory so that the execution results  can be evaluated programmatically.

Prerequisites
-------------
Note that it does have a few Perl dependencies beyond the usual 'strict' and 'Env':

. 'Getopt::Long' to process options
. 'Config::Simple' to process the configuration file.
. 'Socket' to provide hostname resolution.

It also requires some apps that are usually installed on most Linux boxen anyway.:

. 'ssh' for executing the commands (and obviously the nodes have to share ssh keys to provide http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/bduc/BDUC_USER_HOWTO.html#HowtoPasswordlessSsh[passwordless ssh])
. 'mutt', for emailing out notifications (if desired)
. 'diff', for doing comparisons between files of IP #s
. 'yum' or 'apt-get' if you want to use it for updating / installing apps.
. 'mc' (Midnight Commander) a Norton Commander-like clone to view/manipulate files - this is extremely useful for browsing the results of the command.  It may have to be configured to list files in the left pane and the view in the right pane for the best result.
. whatever local apps, scripts, etc that you need to use to generate IP# lists if this is of interest (SGE's 'qhost' to see what nodes are alive, for example).


Installation
------------

for recent Ubuntu-based distros, the following will install the prerequisite packages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install libgetopt-mixed-perl libconfig-simple-perl \
libio-interface-perl mc diff yum apt mutt
----------------------------------------------------------------------

for CentOS5 and comparable RedHat based systems:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ARCH=`uname -a |cut -f 12 -d ' '`   
if [[ ${ARCH} =~ 64 ]]; then ARCH="x86_64"; else ARCH="x86"; fi

sudo yum install perl-Config-Simple.noarch perl-Getopt-Mixed.noarch \
perl-Config-Simple.noarch perl-IO-Interface.$ARCH  mc.$ARCH \
diffutils.$ARCH yum.noarch mutt.$ARCH
----------------------------------------------------------------------
where '$ARCH' is either 'x86' or 'x86_64' if not set by the above query.

Beyond that, the installation requires:

. downloading the http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/clusterfork/clusterfork.pl[clusterfork script itself].
. move it to your '/usr/local/bin' as 'clusterfork' (and optionally, symlink it to 'cf')
. 'chmod' it to make it executable
. run it once to write a '.clusterforkrc' file to your '$HOME' (see below).
. edit that file to adjust it to your local requirements
. start clusterforking.

If you want to use the email features, you need a working sendmail-like agent that mutt can talk to, such as http://www.exim.org[exim] or http://www.postfix.org/[postfix].


Initialization
--------------
The 1st time you use clusterfork, you should get this message (unless you've already copied
a '~.clusterforkrc' file from somewhere else).  Just follow the instructions.
-------------------------------------------------------------

$ clusterfork

        It looks like this is the 1st time you've run clusterfork
        as this user on this system.  An example .clusterforkrc file
        will be written to your home dir. Once you edit it to your
        specifications, run a non-destructive command with it
        (ie 'ls -lSh') to make sure it's working and examine the output
        so that you understand the workflow and the output.

        Remember that in order for clusterfork to work, passwordless ssh keys
        must be operational from the node where you execute clusterfork to the
        client nodes.  If you're going to use sudo to execute clusterfork, the
        root user public ssh key must be shared out to the clients.

        Typical cluster use implies a shared /home file system which means that
        the shared keys should only have to be installed once in
        /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys.

        Please edit the ~/.clusterforkrc template that's just been written so that
        the next time things go smoother.

-------------------------------------------------------------

The .clusterforkrc configuration file
-------------------------------------

The '.clusterforkrc' config file (by default in your $HOME) is arranged like a Windows '.INI' file with stanza headers indicated with '[STANZA]'.  Each stanza can have an arbitrary number of entries, but only the stanzas shown are supported by 'cf'.  Nothing prevents you from adding more, but you'll have to process them yourself.  Within each stanza, you can edit the entries


The stanzas named [IPRANGE] and [GROUPS] can be expanded arbitarily and 'cf' should pick them up.  Additionally, if you specify groups which have overlapping IP ranges, 'cf' will detect that overlap and will only issue the command once per IP #.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the config file for the 'clusterfork' application (aka cf) which executes
# commands on a range of machines defined as below.  Use 'clusterfork -h'
# to view the help file

# Comments start with a pound ('#') sign and //cannot share the same line//
# with other configuration data.

  #   [SCRIPT:"whatever the script is"]
  # with required escaping being embedded in the submitted script
  # (see below for an example in QHOST)

  ADC_ALL = ALL_2X + ADC_4X + CLAWS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[SpecifyingRanges]]
Specifying Ranges
-----------------
The range specifier in 'cf' is fairly flexible (mostly taken from the slice'n'dice utility http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/scut_cols_HOWTO.html[scut]).  You can specify the target ranges with either *IP #s* ('128.200.15.[34:88 -55]') or *alphnumeric hostnames* ('node_[211-345 -255:-258].somenet.podunk.edu').

BUT only 1 variable specification per hostname string, please (don't try 'cn_[45:299].net-[23:35].podunk.edu'; you'll regret it.)

Also, if the 1st number is entered using leading/padding zeros, the numbers emitted will also have the same number of characters.  For example, '[0005:0023]' will generate '0005 0006 0007 ... 0022 0023', as will '[0005:23]' - it's just the 1st number that sets the pad length.

You can also chain specifications like this: (taken from an example '~/.clusterforkrc' file).
-------------------------------------------------------------

# ADC_2X can be specified either with a central negation range:
    ADC_2X = a64-[104:181 -141:-167]
    
# or as this a chain of 2 separated ranges 
# (you must use a ';' as a chain character)
    ADC_2X = a64-[104:140] ; a64-[168:181]
    
# you can also specify hostgroups with chains of mixed IP #s and hostnames
# they should resolve to each other and both are listed on output
    BOOBOO = 10.255.78.[22:46] ; a64-[168:177]

-------------------------------------------------------------

[[hosts]]
Specifying Individual Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can also specify a few hosts to target without doing any complicated ranges, by using the '--hosts' option.  Appending the hostnames or IP #s to this option will allow you target a few specific hosts more easily. See link:#options[Options] below.  remember to quote the string and only use whitespace between the names.

ie:
-------------------------------------------------------------
cf --hosts='nina pinta santa_maria enterprise exxon_valdez'
-------------------------------------------------------------


[[options]]
Options
-------
The options are spelled out fairly well by the 'cf -h' command.  However, here they are again, verbatim.
-------------------------------------------------------------

      --help / -h............. dump usage, tips

      --version / -v ......... dump version #

      --config=/alt/config/file .. an alternative config file.
          On 1st execution, clusterfork will write a template config file
          to ~/.clusterforkrc and exit.  You must edit the template to
          provide parameters for your particular setup.

     --target=[quoted IP_Range or predefined GROUP name]
          where IP_Range -> 12.23.23.[27:45 -33 54:88]
            or  'a64-[00023:35 -25:-28].bduc'
          (Note that leading zeros in the FIRST range specifier will be
          replicated in the output; the above pattern will generate:
            a64-00023.bduc, a64-00024.bduc, a64-00029.bduc, etc)

          where GROUP    -> 'ICS_2X,ADC_4X,CLAWS' (from config file)
          (see docs for longer exposition on IP_Ranges and GROUP definition)

      --hosts=[quoted space-delimited hostnames]
          For those times when you have a random number of hostnames to send.
          ie: --hosts='a64-111  a64-142  a64-183  a64-972'.  This will process
          them in the same way as '--target' above, but without having to spec
          the ranges.
          
      --delay=#  (or #s, #m, #h)
          introduces a this many (s)econds, (m)inutes, or (h)ours between successive 
          commands to nodes to prevent overutilization of resources.  ie between 
          initiating a 'yum -y upgrade' to prevent all the nodes from hitting a 
          local repository simultaneously.  If no s|m|h is given, seconds are assumed.
          Fractions (0.01h) are fine.
          
      --listgroup=[GROUP,GROUP..] (GROUPs from config file)
          If no GROUP specified, dumps IP #s for ALL GROUPS.
          This option does not require a 'remote command' and ignores it
          if given.

      --fork (default) Sends 'remote command' to all nodes in parallel
          and saves output from nodes into a dated subdir for later perusal.
          If you submit a command to run in parallel, it must run to completion
          without intervention.  ie: to install on a CentOS node, the 'yum install'
          command must have the '-y' flag as well: 'yum install -y' to signify
          that 'Y' is assumed to be the answer to all questions.

          If you use the --fork command (as above)), instead of producing the
          stdout/err immediately, a new subdir will be created with the name
          of the format:
             REMOTE_CMD-(20 chars of the command)-time_date
          and the output for each node will be directed into a separate file
          named for the IP number or hostname (whichever the input spec was).

      --nofork .... Execs 'remote command' serially to each specified node and
          emits the output from each node as it's generated.  If executed with
          this option, it will produce a list of stanzas corresponding to the
          nodes requested:
          --------------------------------
          a64-101 [192.168.0.10]:
            <output from the command>

           a64-102 [192.168.0.11]:
             <output from the command>
          --------------------------------

      --script .... causes the command to run without any STDOUT until it emits
          the result dir at the end of the run.  The usual STDOUT is saved as:
          <result_dir>/LOG.

      --debug ..... causes voluminous debug messages to spew forth

-------------------------------------------------------------


Some real-world examples
------------------------

To cause 'cf' to dump its help file into the 'less' pager
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ clusterfork -h
-------------------------------------------------------------

Have 'cf' read the alternative config file './this_cf_file' and
list the groups that are defined there.
-------------------------------------------------------------
clusterfork --config=./this_cf_file  --listgroup
-------------------------------------------------------------

Have 'cf' read the default config file and target the group 'CLAWS' with the command
'ls -lSh'
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ clusterfork  --target=CLAWS  'ls -lSh'
-------------------------------------------------------------

Check the memory error counts for the nodes 192.168.1.15 thru 192.168.1.75 except 192.168.1.66
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ clusterfork --target=192.18.1.[15:75 -66] \
'cd /sys/devices/system/edac/mc &&  grep [0-9]* mc*/csrow*/[cu]e_count'
-------------------------------------------------------------

Tell the nodes in the group ALL_ADC to send a single ping to the login node
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ clusterfork --target=ALL_ADC 'ping -c 1 bduc-login'
-------------------------------------------------------------

Ask the nodes [10.255.78.12 to 10.255.78.45]
and [10.255.35.101 to  10.255.35.165] to dump the catalog of their installed packages.
-------------------------------------------------------------
clusterfork --target='10.255.78.[12:45] 10.255.35.[101:165]' 'dpkg -l'
-------------------------------------------------------------

Ask the nodes in the ADC_2X group to /serially/ dump their hardware memory configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo clusterfork --target=ADC_2X --nofork 'lshw -short -class memory'
-------------------------------------------------------------

Do all the nodes have libXp.so.6?
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ cf --target=QHOST 'locate libXp.so.6
-------------------------------------------------------------


You can use hostnames as well as IP #s:
-------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo clusterfork --target=a64-[0005:0078 -22 -52 -57].bduc 'ps aux |grep gromacs'
-------------------------------------------------------------

Using a script to specify the list of nodes to target:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo clusterfork --target=QHOST 'yum install -y tree'
-------------------------------------------------------------
In the above example, the ~/.clusterforkrc file has the following line:
-------------------------------------------------------------
QHOST = "SCRIPT:qhost |grep a64 | grep -v ' - ' | scut --c1=0 | perl -e 's/\\n/ /gi' -p"
-------------------------------------------------------------
which calls the SGE utility 'qhost', filters the output and stream-edits the STDOUT to create a space-delimited list that can be processed by cf.


Output
------

When 'cf' is executed in 'forking' mode, it waits for all the slave processes to finish, then allows you to view both the Summary and the full results, which are also written to the newly created directory named with a combination of the command, the date and the time:

In the above case, because of the shared dir structure, the 'Summary' shows that the result is identical on all nodes but the 'ls' format differences between the CentOS, Ubuntu, and Debian nodes
create are picked up even when the wordcounts are identical. 

In the case below, there's a lot of zero-length files, which can be deleted before you view them individually.

This last option of the clusterfork analysis allows you to view the results in http://www.midnight-commander.org/[Midnight Commander] (aka 'mc').  The above results shown in 'mc' look like this:

Known Problems
--------------
clusterfork is a fairly new program and while it works pretty well, there are some known or possible problems, mostly having to do with regular expressions.

- regular expressions passed as part of the remote command may suffer in the 'ssh to shell' translation and be garbled on the remote end.  I've been using it in production for about 2 years and have found a few (corrected) problems but it's a consideration, especially when the remote command is complicated.

- the 1st 20 characters of the commandline are used as part of the directory name and regular expressions included as part of those 20 characters may sometimes be garbled into impossible dir names which are rejected by the OS.  An error message should be emitted if this happens and I'm trying to catch and retranslate these regexes.

- if the Linux distro from which you issue the 'cf' command aliases '/bin/sh' to 'dash' instead of 'bash' (as do most recent Ubuntu-derived distros), the redirection of the output when using the default 'fork' behavior will be odd. It will not redirect to the usual files, but will be written to the screen in one blurb.  The 'dash/bash' weirdness also contributes other instabilities, so I usually change this so that '/bin/sh' -> '/bin/bash'.  If too many people complain, I'll add some work-around code to the script.

- in versions prior to 1.55, if the host/IP specification included a negation of the last number in the series, it would write an undef in the last position.  ie: in the spec 'a64-[001:040 -012 -013 -040]', 040 would be undef'ed leading to an warning when running and the last host not being processed (but since it was negated, it wasn't meant to be processed anyway.) 

*PLEASE let me know* if you run into any of these regex problems or other problems.

[[versions]]
Versions & Changes
------------------
- 1.71 - (08.17.12) don't even bother including zero-len results (they're empty fer gadsakes).
- 1.70 - (08.07.12) optionally delete zero-len files before viewing in mc for efficiency. The summary still contains the list of zero-len files if you need them. 
- 1.69 - (07.11.12) fixed small bug in specifying multiple hosts in the IPRANGE stanzas and updated initial .clusterforkrc file for better examples.
- 1.68 - (05.03.12) added config to specify which xterm thingy you want to use. Set as gnome-terminal to begin with. change it to xterm, terminator, konsole, etc. Also, fork the $XTERM so that it leaves the current term able to do something else.
- 1.67 - (04.23.12) added '--script' option to do everything silently and NO query to see results. ie: "cf --script" ends by returning the results dir so that the rest of the script can process the results.
- 1.66 - (01.24.12) corrected subtle PID sed error that led to correct number but empty host list (PIDs sometimes listed with leading space which confused cut)
- 1.65 - (01.20.12) added $RESULTS_DIR to write all results.
- 1.64 - (01.01.12) added hostname tracking to ID hung or trailing hosts.
- 1.63 - (12.28.11) fix ';' delimited IPRANGES bug, single hostname problem/process .
- 1.62 - (12.19.11) added --delay to slow the speed of execution of successive commands.
- 1.61 - redirect STDERR into file along with STDOUT.
- 1.60 - fixed a few more oddball characters that bugger up the dir creation.
- 1.59 - fixed system redirection syntax to be more robust(?) across systems.
- 1.58 - added --hosts=[quoted space-delimited hostnames] option to process a few random hosts
- 1.57 - fixed bug in code that searches for alt config file.  Now only writes the local config file if there is none AND there's no alt config file specified.
- 1.56 - fixed bug introduced in 1.55 that would end the run prematurely - wouldn't get to last number in series; typical off-by-one stupidity.
- 1.55 - fixed bug where if last number in a series was negated, array would overrun, generating an undefined value. (ie a64-[001:040 -012 -013 -040])
- 1.54 - handled single hostname spec in .clusterfork
- 1.52 - added PID tracking and process waiting
- 1.51 -  fixed $padlen for digits that did not have a leading '0'

[[alternatives]]
Alternatives
------------
There are existing tools that do something similar:

- http://code.google.com/p/pdsh/[pdsh] - pdsh is the nicest (and coincidentally, most like 'cf').  It's compiled C and so runs very fast and handles the additional instances as threads instead of extra processes, so it's better behaved when trying to kill off an in-process execution.  It also supports module plug-ins if you need that.  It has a host range specification that's 'almost' as slick as cf's, but it lacks the results compilation/collation function of 'cf' and the ability to 'add' groups together. But a 'very' nice utility, under ongoing development.
- http://code.google.com/p/parallel-ssh/[pssh] - pssh is a very nice set of tools written in Python.  It's fairly mature and has been packaged nicely.  It can use a configuration file (and in fact doesn't allow IP range specification from the commandline), and it can write the results to a dir (but doesn't write a summary or allow in-line viewing.  A nice example is http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/151340[described here].  It doesn't allow as easy a IP range specification, nor grouping as clusterfork.  It also is a set of tools rather than one. But since it is available via both RPM and deb, it is very convenient to install.  If you're using pssh and are familiar with it, I'd suggest staying with it.
- http://clusterit.sourceforge.net/[ClusterIt] - this is a fairly large hammer when all I wanted was to send commands to a set of nodes.  ClusterIt is writ in C, for speed supposedly, tho what it's doing is just issuing commands so speed of execution shouldn't be an issue.  It's also trying to be a scheduling tool which complicates the core functionality of what should be a pretty simple tool.
- http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/clusterssh/index.php?title=Main_Page[clusterssh aka cssh] is a similar tool (but requires tcl/tk).  As such it has some advantages - can set up hosts and de/select hosts via mouse, but you interact with the targets via 1 xterm per host, hardly an efficient use of your desktop.
- http://www.theether.org/gexec/[gexec] (now part of the http://ganglia.info/[ganglia project]) is both considerably more complex and (possibly) more capable than 'cf'.  It requires the installation of 'authd' and the ganglia system. By comparison, 'cf' installs its own config file on 1st run and then is fairly independent.  If you're forking the commands over several thousand nodes instead of a few hundred, gexec may be worth the extra effort.
- http://sourceforge.net/projects/tentakel/files/tentakel/tentakel-2.2/[tentakel]; the home page is down at the moment.  http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/execute-commands-on-multiple-linux-or-unix-servers-part-ii.html[Here's a description tho.]  Very short python script that does what clusterfork did in version 1 when it was still a bash script.
- https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/fermitools/wiki/RGANG[rgang] sounds a lot like clusterfork and can apparently use a tree-structure to spawn copies of itself so that there are multiple copies of itself spawning multiple copies of itself.  If this sounds like a good idea, you should contact Fermilab.

None of the above utils has 'cf's very slick host range specification tho... :)
